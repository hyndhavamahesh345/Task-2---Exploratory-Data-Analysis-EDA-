## 📌 Task 2: AI & ML Internship Assignment
# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset, as part of the Task 2 assignment for the AI & ML Internship.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze and understand the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations in order to:
- Identify patterns in the data
- Understand relationships between features
- Gain insights into survival rates based on demographic and travel attributes

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) from Kaggle.

----

## 📊 What Was Done

1. **Loaded and cleaned the dataset**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Removed irrelevant columns  

2. **Generated summary statistics**  
   - Used `describe()`, `info()`, and `isnull()`  

3. **Visualized distributions**  
   - Histograms and boxplots for Age and Fare  

4. **Explored feature relationships**  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Pairplots  
   - Countplots for gender, class, survival  

5. **Identified insights and patterns**  
   - Analyzed survival rates by gender, class, age, and fare

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Gender**: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 🛏 **Class**: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 2nd or 3rd class.
- 👶 **Age**: Younger passengers (especially children) had higher chances of survival.
- 💸 **Fare**: Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival odds.
