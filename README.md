# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
# Titanic Dataset EDA

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify trends and insights that may help in predictive modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned Titanic dataset
- Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Analyzed correlations using heatmaps
- Compared survival rates across gender, class, age, and fare

## Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances
- Younger passengers were more likely to survive
- Higher fare correlates with better survival odds

## How to Run
Clone the repo and open `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
